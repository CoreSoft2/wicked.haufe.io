# WORK IN PROGRESS

**This is currently work in progress. We will announce here when we think we have reached a state which makes sense looking closer at.**

Some information can already be seen at the wicked microsite over at [wicked.haufe.io](http://wicked.haufe.io).

Things we are currently finishing currently:

* CI and Build processes, setting up official repositories
* [Documentation (work in progress)](doc/index.md)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
