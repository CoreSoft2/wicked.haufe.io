# Wicked (Good) API Management

**This is currently work in progress. We have not yet released version 1.0, but we think it's already well worth having a look at. Feel free to file any issues our requests here on GitHub.**

General information can be seen at the wicked microsite over at [wicked.haufe.io](http://wicked.haufe.io).

Things we are currently finishing currently:

* CI and Build processes, setting up official repositories
* [Documentation (work in progress)](doc/index.md), [Read the docs](http://wickedhaufeio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
